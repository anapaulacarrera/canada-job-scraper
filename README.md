# Automated Job Scraper for Canadian Banking & Insurance Companies

This project builds an automated web scraper that collects data-focused job postings from major Canadian banking and insurance companies. The scraper identifies roles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and BI Analyst, and prepares them for consolidation into a unified dataset. 

The goal is to reduce the time spent manually checking multiple company career pages and to create a centralized dataset aligned with the Toronto job market.
